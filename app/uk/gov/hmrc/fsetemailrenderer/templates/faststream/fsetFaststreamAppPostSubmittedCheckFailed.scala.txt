Thank you for your interest in the Civil Service Summer Internship Programme (SIP).

We have received your application for SIP, but unfortunately we cannot progress your application further as it does not meet the scheme eligibility requirements.

SIP is only open to candidates who are in their final two years of university from a lower socio-economic background. We assess socio-economic background using the measures set out by the Office for National Statistics - https://www.ons.gov.uk/.

If you are still interested in a career in the Civil Service, we would encourage you to look at the following:
