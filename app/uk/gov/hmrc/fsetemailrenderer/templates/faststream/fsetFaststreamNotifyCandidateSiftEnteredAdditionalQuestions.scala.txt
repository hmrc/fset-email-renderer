Congratulations. You're through to the next stage.

At least one of your scheme preferences requires you to answer some additional questions.

Your additional questions will expire on @{params.parameters("expireDateTime")}

You must complete all the additional questions before they expire.

You can withdraw from any of your scheme preferences at this stage.

You will not be able to withdraw from any scheme preference at a later stage.
