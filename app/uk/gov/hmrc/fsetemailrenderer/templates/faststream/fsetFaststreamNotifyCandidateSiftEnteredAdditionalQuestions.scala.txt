Congratulations. You're through to the next stage.

At least one of your scheme preferences requires you to answer some additional questions.This may include a numerical test.

The numerical test is timed and you'll have 25 minutes to complete it. If we've agreed you require extra time, this will be added to the 25 minutes.

Your additional questions, which may include a numerical test, will expire in 7 days. You must complete all the additional questions before they expire.

You can withdraw from any of your scheme preferences at this stage. You will not be able to withdraw from any scheme preference at a later stage.
