You've successfully submitted your application.

For Fast Pass candidates, we will check and validate your certificate number. Once this is done, you will be invited to attend an assessment centre.

Otherwise, the next step is to complete the online exercises.

You can practice one of these exercises by visiting the Fast Stream website and selecting "What do I need to know about the online tests?" 
(http://www.faststream.gov.uk/faqs/)

Once the exercises are ready, you'll be able to do an example question before starting the exercise.

Thank you

Fast Stream team
