You've successfully submitted your application.

You will now need to complete the online exercises.

You can practice one of these exercises by visiting the Fast Stream website and selecting "What do I need to know about the online tests?"
(http://www.faststream.gov.uk/faqs/)

Once the exercises are ready, you'll be able to do an example question before starting the exercise.

For Fast Pass candidates, we will check and validate your certificate number. Once this is done, you will receive an email confirming the next step.

Thank you
