Congratulations. You're through to the next stage.

You need to confirm as soon as possible or you'll lose your booking.

Here are the details of your assessment:

Type: @{params.parameters("eventType")}
Date and time: @{params.parameters("eventDate")} at @{params.parameters("eventStartTime")}
What you need: Read your event guide @{params.parameters("eventGuideUrl")}

Please confirm by 11:59pm on @{params.parameters("deadlineDate")} or you'll lose your booking.

You need to sign in to see where your assessment will be held and to confirm you can attend (@params.parameters("candidateSigninUrl"))

If you cannot attend on this date, please email us at faststream.applicationsupport@@cabinetoffice.gov.uk. We may be able to reschedule your assessment.

If you no longer wish to continue, please sign in and withdraw your application. We'll then stop sending any further emails.
