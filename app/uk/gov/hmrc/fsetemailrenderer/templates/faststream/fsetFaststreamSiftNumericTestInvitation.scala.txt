@(params: uk.gov.hmrc.fsetemailrenderer.controllers.model.Params)@if(params.parameters("name").toString.trim.nonEmpty){Dear @{params.parameters("name")}}

Your chosen schemes require you to complete a numeric test.

The test is now ready for you to complete.

You must finish your test before @{params.parameters("expireDateTime")}.

The numeric test is timed and you'll have 25 minutes to complete it.
If we've agreed you require extra time, this will be added to the 25 minutes.


Sign in to your home page to start the test.
