@(params: uk.gov.hmrc.fsetemailrenderer.controllers.model.Params)@if(params.parameters("name").toString.trim.nonEmpty){Dear @{params.parameters("name")}}

Congratulations, you've successfully passed all the required stages.

We're delighted to be able to offer you a role on the Civil Service Fast Stream, for your chosen scheme/internship:
@{params.parameters("scheme")}

You'll be contacted by the Fast Stream recruitment team in January 2024, with further details of the offer.

In the meantime, we advise that you do not contact us, as we will be extremely busy with the on-going campaign, and/or resign from any employment at this stage (Not applicable for SIP), as you will need to pass pre-employment checks.

We will be back in touch in the new year.

Thank you

Fast Stream team
